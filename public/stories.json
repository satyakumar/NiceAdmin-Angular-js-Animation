When the farmer was a little boy, he spent much of his time playing with the apple tree. However, the old, huge apple tree had stopped bearing fruits a long time ago. \r\n\r\nAlthough it had given the farmer, the choicest of apples, he felt it was of no use now. Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood, climbing the tree and eating its apples.\r\n\r\nNow the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. When the boy, who was now a young farmer, took his ax and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down. \r\n\r\nThey all began to plead with the farmer, who was adamant in cutting the apple tree down. They gathered round the farmer and said, \u201CPlease don\u2019t cut the tree. We used to play with the little boy under this very tree. This is our home and we have no place else to go\u201D. \r\n\r\nAgain, he raised his ax and the commotion grew higher. \r\n\r\n\u201CPlease don\u2019t chop and destroy my home and kids,\u201D cried the squirrel \u201CPlease don\u2019t chop and destroy my nest,\u201D cried the little birds. \u201CPlease don\u2019t cut the apple tree,\u201D cried the grasshopper. \r\n\r\nThe farmer, however forgot his childhood and who were his friends as a little boy. He began to chop the tree harder. All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to protect the apple tree at any cost. \r\n\r\nThe little animals told the farmer, \u201CWe will sing for you, when you are toiling away in the fields. We will look after your little boy. He will not cry, but instead be entertained and happy. You will like our songs and will not feel tired.\u201D However, their cries for help fell on deaf ears. Despite all their requests, the farmer continued to chop down the tree. \r\n\r\nHe suddenly noticed something shiny. On inspecting, he realized that it was a beehive, full of honey. He took a little and put it in his mouth. The taste of the honey woke up the little boy in him. Suddenly, the memories of his childhood came rushing back. The honey tasted so good, that he wanted more. It brought a sense of happiness to him. He smiled and exclaimed, \u201CThis tastes amazing.\u201D \r\n\r\nRealizing the change in the farmer\u2019s attitude, the little animals said in unison; The bee said, \u201CI will always provide you with sweet honey.\u201D The squirrel said, \u201CI will share any amount of nuts that you want.\u201D The birds cried, \u201CWe will sing as many songs as you want.\u201D \r\n\r\nFinally, the farmer realized his folly, and put down his ax. He understood that it was the home to such lovely animals that provided him with so many things, apart from apples. He wanted his little boy to have the childhood that he had. \r\n\r\nThe farmer realized that the apple tree was not that fruitless. The little boy in him saved the apple tree. \r\n\r\nHe threw away the ax and said to the little creatures, \u201CI promise that I would never cut this tree. I have realized my mistake and you all can now live peace and harmony.\u201D \r\n\r\nThe little creatures thanked the bee profusely. If the farmer had not found the beehive by now, they would all been homeless by now. They continued living happily in the old apple tree. ",

You have stolen them!\u2019\r\n\r\nThe worker was shocked to hear this, and he pleaded to his master that he gave whatever his daughter had found. Selfish and greedy, Sam did not accept the worker\u2019s story, and decided to take the issue to court.\r\n\r\nThe judge heard both the sides. He questioned the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag, and they assured it was only 50.\r\n\r\nHe cross-examined Sam and Sam replied, \u2018Yes m\u2019lord, I had 75 gold coins in my bag, and they gave me only 50. Hence, it is quite obvious that they have stolen the balance 25 coins!\u2019\r\n\r\nJudge then asked, \u2018Are you sure you that your bag had 75 coins?\u2019 and Sam nodded his head in acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe judge then made his judgment, \u2018Since Sam lost a bag of 75 gold coins and the bag found by the girl had only 50 coins, it is obvious that the bag found, didn\u2019t belong to Sam, and it was lost by someone else. In addition, if anyone found a bag of 75 gold coins, I will declare that it belongs to Sam. As there are no claims against the loss of 50 coins, I order the girl and his father to take those 50 coins as a token of appreciation for their honesty!\u2019",

One of the monkeys said, \u201CI wish we could find some fire. It will help us to keep warm\u201D.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they noticed a flock of fireflies. One of the young monkeys thought it was fire.\r\n\r\nHe caught a firefly. He put it under a dry leaf and started blowing at it.\r\n\r\nSome other monkeys also joined in his effort.\r\n\r\nA sparrow came flying to its nest. The monkeys were sitting on the same tree. She noticed what they were doing. The sparrow laughed. She said, \u201CHey silly monkeys that is a firefly, not real fire\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe sparrow continued: \u201CI think all of you should take shelter in a cave\u201D. The monkeys did not listen to the sparrow. They continued to blow at our poor firefly.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the monkeys became very tired. Now they realized what the sparrow had said was correct.\r\n\r\nThey set free the firefly and moved to a nearby cave.",
